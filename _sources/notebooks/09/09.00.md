# 9. Stochastic Optimization - Single Stage Problems

In this chapter, there is a number of examples with companion Pyomo implementation that explore various modeling and implementation aspects of stochastic optimization:

* [Optimal management of a pop-up shop](pop-up_shop.ipynb)
* [Markowitz portfolio with chance constraints](markowitz_portfolio_with_chance_constraint.ipynb)
* [Stock optimization for seafood distribution center](seafood.ipynb)
* [Economic dispatch in energy systems](economicdispatch.ipynb)

Go to the [next chapter](../10/10.00.md) about two-stage (robust and stochastic) optimization.
