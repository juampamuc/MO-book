# 10. Two-Stage Problems

In this chapter, there is a number of examples with companion Pyomo implementation that explore various modeling and implementation aspects of two-stage problems affected by uncertainty:

* [Airline seating splitting](01-aircraft-seat-allocation.ipynb)
* [Two-stage production planning](02-two-stage-production-planning.ipynb), a multi-stage variant of the introductory problem from [Chapter 1](../01/01.00.md) solved both with SAA and CCG.
* [Optimal power flow problem with recourse actions](03-opf-linear-decision-rule.ipynb), a two-stage variant of the problem from [Chapter 4](../04/04.00.md) that uses linear decision rules.
* [Extra: Farmer land allocation](04-farmer-problem.ipynb)
* [Extra: Two-stage energy dispatch optimization with wind curtailment](05-opf-wind-curtailment.ipynb), a two-stage variant of the problem from [Chapter 4](../04/04.00.md) with binary second-stage variables.
