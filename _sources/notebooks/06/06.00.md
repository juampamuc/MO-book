# 6. Conic Optimization

In this chapter, there is a number of examples with companion Pyomo implementation that explore various modeling and implementation aspects of conic problems:

* [Economic order quantity](01-economic-order-quantity.ipynb)
* [The Kelly criterion](02-kelly-criterion.ipynb)
* [Markowitz portfolio optimization problem revisited](03-markowitz-portfolio-revisited.ipynb)
* [Optimal design of multi-layered building insulation](04-building-insulation.ipynb)
* [Support Vector Machines with conic optimization](05-svm-conic.ipynb)
* [Extra material: Luenberger's investment wheel](06-investment-wheel.ipynb)
* [Extra material: Optimal growth portfolio](07-optimal-growth-portfolios.ipynb)

Go to the [next chapter](../07/07.00.md) about what happens when optimization meets reality and needs to account for uncertainty.
