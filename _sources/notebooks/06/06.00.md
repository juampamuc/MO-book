# 6. Conic Optimization

In this chapter, there is a number of examples with companion Pyomo implementation that explore various modeling and implementation aspects of conic problems:

* [Economic order quantity](economic-order-quantity.ipynb)
* [The Kelly Criterion](kelly-criterion.ipynb)
* [Markowitz portfolio optimization problem revisited](markowitz_portfolio_revisited.ipynb)
* [Optimal design of multi-layered building insulation](building-insulation.ipynb)
* [Training Support Vector Machines with Conic Programming](svm-conic.ipynb)
* [Extra material: Luenberger's Investment Wheel](investment-wheel.ipynb)
* [Extra material: Optimal Growth Portfolio](optimal-growth-portfolios.ipynb)

Go to the [next chapter](../07/07.00.md) about what happens when optimization meets reality and needs to account for uncertainty.
