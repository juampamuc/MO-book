If run on Google Colab, the cell installs Pyomo and the HiGHS solver, while, if run elsewhere, it assumes Pyomo and HiGHS have been previously installed. It then sets to use HiGHS as solver via the appsi module and a test is performed to verify that it is available. The solver interface is stored in a global object `SOLVER` for later use."

Let us consider the [BIM microchip production problem](01-bim.ipynb), but suppose that there is uncertainty regarding the selling prices of the microchips. Instead of just the nominal prices 12$ and 9$, BIM estimates that prices may more generally take values $P=\\{ (12,9), (11,10), (8, 11) \\}$. The optimization problem for a production plan that achieves the maximum among the lowest possible profits can be formulated using the trick mentioned above and can be implemented in Pyomo as follows."
